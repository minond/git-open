`git-open` opens things for you, such as:

    - `git open` for loading a repo's web homepage
    - `git open mr` for loading a Gitlab MR for the current branch
    - `git open <file>` for loading any file on the web ui

Add a new alias to your git config file for convenience:

    [alias]
      open = !git-open
